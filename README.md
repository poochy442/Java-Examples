## [REST api](https://github.com/poochy442/Java-Examples/tree/master/REST%20api)
This api uses Spring Boot to implement standard CRUD-operations on an ADT and exposes them to the localhost.
The api has been implemented with a Database Adapter for Database connections, although it is not fully implemented as the focus of this project is the api.
